#  The Really Annoying Project Manager (Yes Boss) has made a spec change!

#  "There will be an amoeba shape on the screen, with the others. When the user 
#  clicks on the amoeba, it will rotate like the others, and play a .hif sound 
#  file. The other figures like rectangle rotate around the center. I want the 
#  amoeba shape to rotate around a point on one end, like a clock hand !"
