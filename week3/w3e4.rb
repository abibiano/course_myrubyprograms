#  Exercise4. Given the following Ruby code snippet:
#
#  a = (1930...1951).to_a
#  puts a[rand(a.size)]
#  When you run this program, which of the following values will not be displayed?
#  1929
#  1930
#  1945
#  1950
#  1951
#  1952
#  Explain why that value will not be displayed.
#
#  Also, have a look at the splat operator:
#
#  a = [*1930...1951] # splat operator
