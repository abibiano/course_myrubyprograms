#  Exercise13 Ruby is a DRY language. Ruby helps you keep your code short and
#  concise. DRY stands for: Don’t Repeat Yourself Syntactically, it’s a very
#  efficient language: you can express the same thing with less lines of code.
#  As we know, computers are fast enough that more lines of code do not slow
#  them down. But what about you? When it comes to debugging and maintaining,
#  the more code you have to deal with, the harder it is to see what it does
#  and find the problems that need fixing. Here's some code:
#
#  # The long way
#  record = Hash.new
#  record[:name] = “Satish”
#  record[:email] = “mail@satishtalim.com”
#  record[:phone] = “919371006659”
#  Rewrite, the above code in one line, the DRY (or Ruby) way.
record = { :name => "Satish", :email => "mail@satishtalim.com", :phone => "919371006659" }
