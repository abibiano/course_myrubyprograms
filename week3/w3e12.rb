#  Exercise12. Something to keep your grey cells ticking.
#
#  I have a database of all the course participants. I want to know the number
#  of participants who have not attempted Quiz 1 (is it so scary ?). A student
#  writes a clever Ruby program that creates an array of 0's and 1's. 0's 
#  indicate that the participant has not attempted the Quiz and the 1's have
#  attempted it.
#
#  Use this array quiz:
#
#  quiz = [0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,1]
#  and write another clever program to solve my problem. That is display the
#  number of participants who have not attempted Quiz 1.
#
#  The output of your program should be as follow:
#  The number of participants who did not attempt Quiz 1 is x out of y total 
#  participants.
