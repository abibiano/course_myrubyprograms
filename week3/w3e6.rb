#  Exercise6. Write a Deaf Grandma program. Whatever you say to grandma
#  (whatever you type in), she should respond with HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!,
#  unless you shout it (type in all capitals). If you shout, she can hear you
#  (or at least she thinks so) and yells back, NO, NOT SINCE 1938! To make your
#  program really believable, have grandma shout a different year each time;
#  maybe any year at random between 1930 and 1950. You can't stop talking to
#  grandma until you shout BYE.
#
#  Adapted from Chris Pine#'s Book.
#
#  For example:
#
#  You enter: Hello Grandma
#  Grandma responds: HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
#  You enter: HELLO GRANDMA
#  Grandma responds: NO, NOT SINCE 1938!
