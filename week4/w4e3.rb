#  3. Modify your Deaf Grandma program (written
#  earlier): What if grandma doesn't want you to leave?
#  When you shout BYE, she could pretend not to hear
#  you. Change your previous program so that you have
#  to shout BYE three times in a row. Make sure to test
#  your program: if you shout BYE three times, but not
#  in a row, you should still be talking to grandma. You
#  must shout BYE three separate times. If you shout
#  BYEBYEBYE or BYE BYE BYE, grandma should
#  pretend not to hear you (and not count it as a BYE).
