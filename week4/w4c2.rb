#
#  A little challenge (I know, it’s outside of the contract, but as an ex-English
#  major I’ve got to bring this up):
#
#  How many sentences are there in the following sentence (taken from the text):
#
#  ‘It’s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!’ said the surgeon at last.
#
#  (Hint: *one. )
#
#  But how many sentences are your evaluations returning?
#
#  Anyone care to make a method that will correctly evaluate the number of
#  sentences?
#
#  And that might even correctly evaluate something like:
#
#  Drs. Smith and Jones (i.e. Mr. Frank’s doctors) both said, “Hurrah! A cure
#  has been found!”
