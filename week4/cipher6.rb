#  NOTE: This is an extra exercise. Please try to do after the Step 5. 
#
#  Are you enjoying Playfair Cipher exercise? 
#
#  BTW, wouldn't it be nice if we could have a following hash table?
#
#  cipher table : [["W", "E", "L", "O", "V"],
#                  ["R", "U", "B", "Y", "A"],
#                  ["C", "D", "F", "G", "H"],
#                  ["I", "K", "M", "N", "P"],
#                  ["Q", "S", "T", "X", "Z"]]
#  hash table : {"AA"=>"RR", "AB"=>"RY", "AC"=>"RH", ..... "ZZ"=>"QQ"}
#
#
#  - keys are all combination, values are digraphs encoded with cipher table.
#
#  Can anyone give me the hash table? 
#
#  Have fun,
