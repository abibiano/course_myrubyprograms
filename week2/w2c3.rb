# by: Victor Goff – Sunday, 2 November 2008, 04:03 PM
# There is a way to not have to have your line_num variable hanging around 
# outside of the block. Did you find it?
# 
# @Everyone… Challenge?
# 
# Can you do something so that if it isn’t simply 3 lines, or 1000 lines, 
# your output ends up something like this? (leading spaces or 0’s acceptable)
# Line    1: output line    1
# Line    9: output line    9
# Line  100: output line  100
# Line 1000: output line 1000
# 
# Where the : remains aligned as well as the first letter of the line?
# 
# Here is sample output from my test method…
# Line 01: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
# Line 02: Duis imperdiet sem eu quam.
# Line 03: Donec bibendum tincidunt purus.
# Line 04: Nunc eu tellus sed turpis volutpat pellentesque.
# Line 05: Nunc accumsan varius elit.
# Line 06: Aenean sit amet magna eget odio ornare vulputate.
# Line 07: Ut ullamcorper tellus non magna.
# Line 08: Sed non arcu vel libero posuere ultricies.
# Line 09: Suspendisse tincidunt ullamcorper tellus.
# Line 10: In ornare lacus ut turpis.
# 
#  
# Anyone else know of a challenge that they think should be able to be solved 
# with the knowledge gained so far? You can also update the first week 
# challenges with things learned from this week if you find it makes it simpler,
# or more elegant! Blocks anyone?
